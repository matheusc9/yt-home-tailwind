# YouTube Homepage Tailwind

This project is a simple clone of YouTube's homepage, built as a study exercise while learning modern web technologies. It demonstrates the use of **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and a bit of **JavaScript** to recreate the structure and style of YouTube's main interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 📺 Header with search bar, menu button, and user icons
- 📄 Sidebar navigation menu with YouTube-like sections
- 🎥 Video grid showcasing example videos (using placeholder images)
- 💡 Dynamic rendering of video cards with metadata
- 🌙 Toggleable sidebar (show/hide) functionality

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and layout
- **Remix Icon** for icons
- **JavaScript** for dynamic behaviors (such as toggling the sidebar and rendering video data)

## 💻 How It Works

The project consists of a single HTML file that includes:

- A **fixed header** at the top with navigation controls and search functionality.
- A **sidebar menu** on the left, which can be toggled on and off.
- A **main content area** displaying video cards in a responsive grid layout.
- A JavaScript block at the bottom to handle menu toggling and dynamically generate video cards from an array of data.

The video cards are rendered using placeholder images (via [Picsum](https://picsum.photos)) and display information such as:

- Title
- Channel name
- Number of views
- Time since published
- Duration or "LIVE" badge if live

## ⚡ Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Explore the page — try toggling the sidebar, using the search bar, and scrolling through the videos.

## 🎨 Customization

You can easily:

- Update the video data inside the `videos` array in the `<script>` tag.
- Replace placeholder images with real thumbnails.
- Adjust styling using Tailwind utility classes.

## 📚 What I Learned
